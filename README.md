# Travel and Tourism Management System ‚úàÔ∏è

**A comprehensive, feature-rich desktop application for managing a complete travel agency workflow, built with Java Swing and MySQL.**

This project is a fully functional simulation of a travel management system. It provides a robust desktop GUI for users to manage their travel plans, from creating an account and booking packages to viewing itineraries and making payments. It serves as a practical demonstration of Java application development, database management, and object-oriented programming principles.
