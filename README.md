* **Book Package:** A form that allows the user to select a package, specify the number of people traveling, and view the calculated total price before confirming the booking.
* **View Package:** After booking, this screen shows the user the complete details of their confirmed package, pulling data from the `bookpackage` table.

### 🏨 Hotel Management
